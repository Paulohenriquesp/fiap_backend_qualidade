# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently has misalignments between API models and database table structures, causing inconsistencies in property names, types, and missing properties. This feature will systematically align the API models with the database schema to ensure data consistency, improve maintainability, and prevent runtime errors caused by property mismatches.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API models to accurately reflect database table structures, so that data operations are consistent and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Post is created or retrieved THEN the API model SHALL include all database fields (id, title, content, author_id)
2. WHEN a Post model is used THEN it SHALL use consistent property names that match database columns
3. IF a Post has an author_id field THEN the API model SHALL reflect this instead of using 'author'

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Comment models to use consistent field names, so that database operations work without field mapping issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Comment is processed THEN the API model SHALL use 'user_id' to match the database column instead of 'author_id'
2. WHEN a Comment content is handled THEN the API model SHALL use 'comentario' to match the database column instead of 'content'
3. WHEN Comment queries are executed THEN field mappings SHALL be consistent between API and database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database query results to match API model structures, so that no additional field mapping is required in controllers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries return results THEN the field names SHALL match the API model properties
2. WHEN Post queries include user information THEN the returned fields SHALL align with expected API model structure
3. WHEN Comment queries are executed THEN the returned field names SHALL match the Comment API model

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type safety between API models and database operations, so that TypeScript can catch mismatches at compile time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database methods are called THEN they SHALL use the same type definitions as API models
2. WHEN partial updates are performed THEN the type system SHALL enforce correct property names
3. IF a database field is renamed THEN the corresponding API model SHALL be updated to maintain type safety
