# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update API model interfaces to align with database schema





  - Update Post interface to include id, change author to author_id, and add materia field
  - Update Comment interface to change author_id to user_id and content to comentario, add resposta_id
  - Ensure all models include optional id and timestamp fields from database
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 2. Update database query methods to return aligned field names





  - [x] 2.1 Modify Post database queries to remove field aliasing and include all database columns


    - Update queryPosts method to return author_id instead of mapping fields
    - Include materia field in Post query results
    - Ensure id field is properly returned in all Post operations
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 5.1_

  - [x] 2.2 Modify Comment database queries to use consistent field names


    - Update comment queries to return user_id instead of author_id aliasing
    - Change content field mapping to return comentario directly
    - Include resposta_id field in comment query results
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.2, 5.2_

  - [x] 2.3 Update database method signatures to use aligned types


    - Modify createPost, updatePost methods to accept aligned Post interface
    - Update createComment, updateComment methods to use aligned Comment interface
    - Ensure method return types match the updated model interfaces
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Update controller implementations to use aligned models





  - [x] 3.1 Update PostController to handle aligned Post model


    - Modify create method to work with author_id instead of author field
    - Update update method to handle aligned field names
    - Remove manual field mapping in controller methods
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 4.2_



  - [ ] 3.2 Update CommentController to use aligned Comment model
    - Modify methods to work with user_id and comentario fields
    - Remove field mapping between controller and database layer
    - Ensure consistent field usage throughout comment operations
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Update controller action interfaces to reflect aligned models
  - Update PostControllerActions interface to use aligned Post model
  - Update CommentControllerActions interface to use aligned Comment model
  - Ensure interface method signatures match updated implementations
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 5. Update unit tests to work with aligned models
  - [ ] 5.1 Update PostController tests to use aligned field names
    - Modify test data to use author_id instead of author
    - Update test assertions to expect aligned field names in responses
    - Add tests for new materia field handling
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 5.1_

  - [ ] 5.2 Update CommentController tests to use aligned field names
    - Change test data to use user_id and comentario fields
    - Update test expectations to match aligned Comment model
    - Test resposta_id field handling in comment operations
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 5.2_

  - [ ] 5.3 Update database method tests to verify aligned data structures
    - Test that database methods return data matching aligned models
    - Verify type safety with aligned interfaces
    - Test partial update operations with correct field names
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 6. Verify type safety and compilation
  - Run TypeScript compilation to catch any remaining field name mismatches
  - Ensure all database operations use correct property names
  - Verify controller methods properly handle aligned model fields
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 7. Run integration tests to verify end-to-end alignment
  - Test complete data flow from API to database with aligned models
  - Verify no field mapping errors occur in real operations
  - Ensure all CRUD operations work correctly with aligned field names
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
